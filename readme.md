This is my ScrapBook!  This is where snippets of code I write go to live on!  There's just going to be a lot of random scripts in here, mainly.  Maybe a couple gems, maybe not.

I write a lot of code all the time, and not all of it is useful, but it seems like a shame just to get rid of them.  Enjoy poking around and don't be afraid to contact me with any questions!
